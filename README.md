# Jennifer - A Simple PHP Framework

Jennifer is a simple PHP framework that implements the Ajax MVC pattern. The idea of  aMVC and first pieces of code was written in 2008 when I doing my Master at University of Sydney and taking on job to develope the CMS for Allimport. But only recently I manage to put the code into the framework, and name it Jennifer.

For example of implementation and usage, please take a look at Thedaysoflife project https://github.com/ngodinhloc/thedaysoflife.com which was developed using Jennifer framework
